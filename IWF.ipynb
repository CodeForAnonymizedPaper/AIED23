At this rate, the constantly high demand for energy causes my oxygen consumption and proton pump activity increase in order to keep with the ATP usage and synthesis.\n",

A large increase in blood glucose also stimulates insulin, which facilitates lipolysis and the release of fatty acids into the bloodstream, sparing the use of glycogen by muscles.\n",
      "Since carnitine is a carrier involved in facilitating the entry of fatty acids into mitochondria, during strenuous exercise, the ingestion of carnitine supplements ensures the rate of fatty acid oxidation is at its maximal rate. This can help to increase the amount of energy gained from fatty acid oxidation, hence decreasing the energy gained from carbohydrates, and therefore sparing glycogen.\n",

Recently, having come into some money, he was able to purchase an airfare to visit during next year&rsquo;s carnival. He plans to bribe his entry into the event upon his arrival. Aware of the strenuous exercise to which he is likely to subject his body, Greg investigates possible supplement regimes. Amused by the irony of using Bovine Colostrum in an event featuring bulls he pours hours into researching the substance. In the dark corners of the internet he finds the following: Bovine colostrum is the milk weaned from cows shortly after they give birth. It is rich in nutrients, proteins, immune cells and insulin growth factors (IGF-1). Table 1: The biochemical components of Bovine Colostrum in comparison to whole cow&rsquo;s milk. Data sourced from (Mero et al. 1997) and (Ahmadi-Vincu et al. 2005). Using these details Greg must come to his own conclusions about the potential effects of Bovine Colostrum should it be used as a sports supplement. Which of the statements below represents the most correct conclusion that Greg could safely draw?\n",
      " The lower level of lactose in Bovine Colostrum, compared to other solutions, willreduce acid accumulation in muscle cells. Acids interfere with the enzymes that facilitate glycolysis and the action of contractile filaments in muscles. Thus,lowering their levels will increase the body&rsquo;s capacity tofunction under strenuous exerciseconditions.\n",
      "The higher percentage of minerals in Bovine Colostrum, compared to other solutions, means that there are increased mineral co-factors available for enzymatic processes like glycolysis. This means that the body can tightly control its use of resources. Thus, muscle cells may, more efficiently, produce ATP for utilisation in strenuous exercise.\n",
      "The higher concentration of IGF-1 in Bovine Colostrum, compared to other solutions, may increase the body&rsquo;s capacity to build lean muscle. An increasedpresence of contractile filaments, in association with increased calcium intake, should increase the body&rsquo;s ability to perform under the conditions of strenuous exercise.\n",
      "The higher concentration of immunoglobins in Bovine Colostrum, compared to other solutions, increases the functional capacity of the immune system. This is likely to reduce the chance of microbial infections which mayexploit the ATP reservesthat cells produce for utilisation in movement.\n",
      "Correct option: The higher concentration of IGF-1 in Bovine Colostrum, compared to other solutions, may increase the body&rsquo;s capacity to build lean muscle.

      "Question: Kosmas, C.E. et al.:- \"In a recent study, evacetrapib, alone or in combination with statins, was found to increase cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), including the ABCA1-specific CEC.\" Information regarding this claim in the text: The HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) is the ability of HDL to accept cholesterol from macrophages and is used as a biomarker for cardiovascular events . CEC , instead of HDL particle concentration, was found to be the causal factor for the link between HDL and atherosclerosis, for which an inverse correlation was seen. (Rohatgi, A. et al. 2014) Statins are drugs that have been proven to decrease the likelihood of cardiovascular disease. (Taylor, F. 2013) Below is from the reference Kosmas, C.E. et al. used to justify the claim above. What do these results suggest? Figure 1: Legend as above. Note that graphs (B) and (C) have been omitted from this image. Only Total CEC is shown. References: Kosmas, C.E., DeJesus, E., Rosario, D. and Vittorio, T.J., 2016.

      "Question: C3-A04 The microbiota in our colon is a wonderful community. It is able to take otherwise indigestible polysaccharides, such as dietary fibre, and turn it into useful short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). However, depending on the composition of the colonic microbiota, different amounts of SCFA will be produced. A microbiota with increased abundance of Firmicutes and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes is able to process fibre well, and produces SCFA more efficiently. However, excess SCFA production can lead to weight gain due to the extra caloric content extracted from the dietary fibre. The root cause of obesity is excess caloric intake compared to expenditure. Based on this information (and ignoring the effects of SCFA on FFAs - as mentioned in the journal article), which one of the following conditions are most likely to contribute to obesity, assuming the rest of the diet is exactly the same?\n",

However when he goes to the butchers they have two types of muscle (Red and White)! Knowing that his mum loves a juicy meal and loves the presence of Mitochondria in her meat as it is sweet! Question 1: Which meat should he buy according to his mother's taste in muscle meat? Right before eating, cannibals add a spice called \"Blue Ribbon\" which is an agonist and binds to the receptors of the muscle and causes it to contract. A muscle that quickly contracts will be very rough and hard to eat when chewing! While a muscle that slowly contracts will be softer and easier to eat.

      "Question: C1-18: Rate Limiting Steps in Fatty Acid Oxidation The attachment of fatty acids on carnitine by carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT-I) and their subsequent transport into the mitochondria is often considered the rate-limiting step in &beta;-oxidation in the liver. The discovery of an alien species reveals that fatty acids are oxidised in the same way in their bodies and where in their liver, the CAT-I reaction is also the rate-limiting step. However, in their heart and skeletal muscle, the concentration of malonyl-CoA is estimated to be in a range that would, in theory, produce a constant inhibition on heart and skeletal muscle CAT-I. Yet, &beta;-oxidation still proceeds in the heart and skeletal muscle in these aliens. Which of the following possibilities cannot account for this observation? (Question inspired by Eaton 2002 (Eaton, S 2002, &lsquo;Control of mitochondrial &beta;-oxidation flux&rsquo;, Progress in Lipid Research, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 197&ndash;239.))\n",

      "Question: C3-A15 The characters in the following question have no physiological or biochemical differences to humans on Earth. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... Little did people know that Emperor Palpatine was actually morbidly obese. He relied on his power in the Force to keep himself healthy, but as he aged his power diminished and his health deteriorated. Darth Vader, the Emperor's apprentice, has found a research study on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The study hypothesised that in overweight subjects, intake of resistant starch (RS), an insoluble dietary fibre, or inulin (IN), a soluble dietary fibre, would elicit higher post-meal SCFA responses and have less of an effect in reducing the amount of free fatty acids (FFA) in serum. In essence, the hypothesis was that intake of RS or IN causes excess SCFA and leads to obesity. As Darth read through the results section, he came across these figures about acetate, an example of an SCFA. Based on the hypothesis and the results above, what should Darth recommend the Emperor? Figures from Rahat-Rozenbloom et al. (2017).\n",

      "Question: Antioxidant Physical exercise increases free-radical production in active skeletal muscles, responsible for oxidative damage to cells, and contributes to muscular fatigue during prolonged exercise. Free-radical is unstable, therefore highly reactive and promote oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA i.e. causing oxidative damaged. This may lead to cellular dysfunction and cell death. James starts getting serious in exercise for his dreamy six-pack. He uses antioxidant supplements because he thought that with increase physical exercise and increase free-radical production in his body, he also needs to increase his antioxidant intake to &lsquo;balance things out&rsquo; as well. Also because he wants to get his dreamy six-pack as fast as possible, antioxidant will increase his endurance hence more exercise could be done in each day. What is the most likely reason that his choice of antioxidant supplement intake is a good choice/ uncalled for?\n",
      " It is a good choice. Because without increase antioxidant consumption, it is very likely that free-radical will damage proteins, lipids and/or DNA in his body.\n",

      "It is uncalled for. Because endogenous antioxidant will be enough to balance the free-radical produced from exercise.\n",
      "It is uncalled for. Because exercise might cause cells to produce more free-radical, but it also will produce more endogenous antioxidant, and with natural dietary antioxidant intake (e.g. in orange), there won&rsquo;t be ill effect on the body.\n",
